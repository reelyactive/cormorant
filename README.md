cormorant
=========

Client-side library to fetch associations from [chickadee](https://github.com/reelyactive/chickadee) and to fetch JSON from a URL, regardless if the GET returns JSON or HTML.  __cormorant.js__ will collect all structured, linked data about _who/what is where/how_, making this real-time information available to the web application.


Installation
------------

__cormorant.js__ is written in vanilla JavaScript and the file can simply be included among the scripts in an HTML file.  For example:

```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="js/cormorant.js"></script>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

What's in a name?
-----------------

Cormorants are a family of aquatic birds well adapted for diving to catch fish in their long, slender bill which is hooked in an _Angular_ kind of way.  In its client-side habitat, cormorant.js will commonly dive into pools created by [beaver.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/cormorant) in search of linked data, adeptly swimming from URL to URL, to collect its prey: JSON-LD.

Cormorants are also known as shags.  If you’ve read our other mascot stories, at this point you may be surprised that we didn’t play on the shag & beaver theme.  We could have, but it seems rather tame once you discover the mechanics of how that goes down for our other mascot, the [cuttlefish](https://github.com/reelyactive/cuttlefish)!
