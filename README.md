=========

Fetch JSON from a URL, regardless if the GET returns JSON or HTML.  In the case of the latter, [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) will be extracted, if present.  We believe in an open Internet of Things.


In the scheme of Things (pun intended)
--------------------------------------

The [beaver.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/beaver), __cormorant.js__ and [cuttlefish.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/cuttlefish) modules work together as a unit.  See our [dashboard-template-angular](https://github.com/reelyactive/dashboard-template-angular) for a minimal implementation.

What's in a name?
-----------------

Cormorants are a family of aquatic birds well adapted for diving to catch fish in their long, slender bill which is hooked in an _Angular_ kind of way.  In its client-side habitat, cormorant.js will commonly dive into pools created by [beaver.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/cormorant) in search of linked data, adeptly swimming from URL to URL, to collect its prey: JSON-LD.

Cormorants are also known as shags.  If you’ve read our other mascot stories, at this point you may be surprised that we didn’t play on the shag & beaver theme.  We could have, but it seems rather tame once you discover the mechanics of how that goes down for our other mascot, the [cuttlefish](https://github.com/reelyactive/cuttlefish)!


Hello cormorant
---------------

```javascript
angular.module('appName', [ 'reelyactive.cormorant' ])

  .controller('LinkedDataCtrl', function($scope, cormorant) {

    var url1 = 'http://www.reelyactive.com';
    var url2 = 'https://reelyactive.github.io/stories/hq/';

    $scope.stories = cormorant.getStories();

    cormorant.getStory(url1, function(story, url) {
      console.log(story);
    });

    cormorant.getCombinedStory(url1, url2, null, function(story, id) {
      console.log(story);
    });
  });
```

Include the above in a .js file, and then source both that file and cormorant.js in an HTML file.  Upon running the HTML file, the JSON-LD embedded in reelyactive.com will be output to the console.


What's next?
------------

In future, cormorant will recursively fetch JSON from URLs contained in the preceding fetch.  If you're developing with cormorant, check out:
